Software Engineering 2 - Team Based project

Team Members: Nicolas Ferradas, Nick Lovera, Christian Yawn, Cristiano Caon, Safwan Hasan

The project consists on 4 parts:
  1. The client app (walletClient)
  2. The server app (walletServer)
  3. The Personalized Java Library (walletLib)
  4. Database
  

The server app could run on the server, but it can be tested in the same device using localhost as the host.

*Database path does need to be speficied if tested in local host form*
